2. Problem Statement

Many commercial banking customers struggle with accurately forecasting cash flows due to incomplete or delayed data. In the demo environment, real-time data feeds are either unavailable or too volatile for early testing. The use of simulated data enables stakeholders to see realistic, yet controlled, AI predictions that mimic real-world scenarios, while ensuring the demo remains robust and easy to understand.

5. Key Features

A. Simulated Data Module
	•	Data Generation Engine:
	•	Generate realistic simulated financial data including transactions, invoices, payments, receivables, and payables.
	•	Use configurable parameters (e.g., transaction volume, variability, seasonality) to create data sets that mimic different industry scenarios.
	•	Historical Data Simulation:
	•	Provide a “past 12 months” view of simulated data to train and validate the forecasting model.
	•	Include variability to showcase how unusual events (e.g., seasonal peaks, unexpected expenses) affect cash flow.
	•	Real-Time Data Simulation:
	•	Emulate real-time data feeds for the demo, updating dashboards at configurable intervals.
	•	Allow users to toggle between static historical views and live simulated data streams.

B. AI-Powered Forecasting Engine
	•	Forecasting Models:
	•	Implement time-series forecasting algorithms (e.g., Prophet, ARIMA, LSTM) to predict future cash inflows and outflows over multiple horizons (e.g., 30, 60, 90 days).
	•	Use ensemble techniques to increase accuracy and provide prediction confidence intervals.
	•	Anomaly Detection:
	•	Identify outlier transactions and unusual patterns that could signal potential liquidity issues.
	•	Integrate automated alerts when the model detects significant deviations from expected trends.
	•	Simulation Adjustment:
	•	Enable the AI engine to adjust forecasts based on changes in simulated parameters (e.g., sudden increase in expenses or delayed receivables).

C. Liquidity Risk Alerts
	•	Threshold-Based Notifications:
	•	Set configurable thresholds for minimum liquidity levels.
	•	Trigger visual and email alerts when forecasted cash balances are projected to fall below these thresholds.
	•	Risk Scoring:
	•	Provide a liquidity risk score based on the variance between forecasted and actual cash flows.
	•	Display risk levels (e.g., low, moderate, high) on the dashboard.

D. Dashboard & Visualization
	•	Interactive Charts:
	•	Visualize historical and forecasted cash flow trends with line charts and bar graphs.
	•	Show comparisons between actual versus predicted cash flows, including confidence intervals.
	•	KPI Widgets:
	•	Display key performance indicators such as Days Sales Outstanding (DSO), Days Payable Outstanding (DPO), Net Cash Position, and Burn Rate.
	•	Time-Line and Calendar Views:
	•	Integrate calendar views for scheduling significant predicted liquidity events and alerts.

E. Conversational AI Interface (Optional)
	•	Natural Language Queries:
	•	Allow users to ask questions like “What’s our forecasted cash balance for next month?” or “Are there any liquidity risks in the next quarter?”
	•	Leverage NLP models to parse queries and return relevant forecast data and visualizations.
	•	Interactive Assistant:
	•	Provide suggestions or follow-up questions based on user input, making it easier to explore insights.
